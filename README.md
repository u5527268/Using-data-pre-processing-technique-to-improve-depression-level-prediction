# Using-data-pre-processing-technique-to-improve-depression-level-prediction
Depression level prediction can be achieved by using a neural network with physiological responses data. The data pre-processing technique plays a vital role in building the neural network model. This report demonstrates using normalization data processing method to improve the neural network performance and generate a meaningful prediction of the depression level prediction. Also, the final result compared with the original dataset paper, which approved the importance of data pre-processing during the neural network building process.  

the neural network parameters use a hidden layer with size 50, four output neurons, adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss function, which comes from “Detecting emotional reaction to videos of depression” paper. 
The evaluation method, using precision, recall and F1 score
overfitting was tackled by dropout and early stopping
