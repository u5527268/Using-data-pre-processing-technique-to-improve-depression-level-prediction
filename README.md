# Using-data-pre-processing-technique-to-improve-depression-level-prediction
Depression level prediction can be achieved by using a neural network with physiological responses data. The data pre-processing technique plays a vital role in building the neural network model. This report demonstrates using normalization data processing method to improve the neural network performance and generate a meaningful prediction of the depression level prediction. Also, the final result compared with the original dataset paper, which approved the importance of data pre-processing during the neural network building process.
